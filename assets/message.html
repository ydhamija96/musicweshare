<h2>Hey sweet one,</h2>
<p style="padding:none; margin:none; margin-left:20px; margin-right:20px; font-size:16px;">
    We&#39;ve been through a lot lately. Good news is that we made it&mdash; you still have me. Or, wait, is that bad news?
    <br /><br />
    So, once again, here&#39;s how this is going to work:&nbsp;
    <br /><br />
    One day soon, over ice cream, we&#39;re going to sit down and listen to a bunch of music. You're going to complain about my taste, and I'm going to complain about yours. And we're going to find a bunch <i>more</i> songs that we both like and put them here, along with the ones already here.&nbsp;
    <br /><br />
    Or, who knows, we might get bored and microwave a pizza instead.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:right; float:right; margin-top:-8px;">Still your biggest problem, <br /><span style="color:blue;">Yogi</span></h2>
