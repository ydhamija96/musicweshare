<h2 style="color:#A50707; margin-bottom:15px;">Hey,</h2>
<p style="padding:none; margin:none; margin-left:20px; margin-top:10px;margin-right:20px; font-size:16px;">
    I'm glad you're here. This has been some of my best work; I'm glad it's still in use.
    <br><br>
    I'm sorry that we didn't work out. Yes, it was my fault.
    <br><br>
    I'm very lucky to have been with you. I hope that &mdash; even if you don't consider your time
    with me a happy time &mdash; that you remember the good parts. I hope you think of me
    fondly every once in a while.
    <br><br>
    See you around.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:right; float:right; margin-top:2px;color:#A50707;">&mdash; Y</h2>
