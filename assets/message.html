<h2 style="color:#A50707">Hey sweet one,</h2>
<p style="padding:none; margin:none; margin-left:20px; margin-top:10px;margin-right:20px; font-size:16px;">
    You are the most amazing, beautiful, fantastic, <i>heart-warming</i> thing
    in the world; and I adore you.<br /><br />
    You remind me every day of why I like you so much. I could try to explain it here,
    but the internet would run out of space. <br /><br />
    You're kind, smart, and beautiful. You're a good friend, and you're
    fun. And <i>for some reason</i> you decided to make me your boyfriend.<br /><br />
    You don't even realize how lucky I am.
</p>
<h2 style="text-align:right; float:right; margin-top:2px;color:#A50707;">Your most annoying problem,<br />Yogi</h2>
